# IF
An inventory framework for manging GUIs

This framework is based on a pane principle. This means that the GUi is divided into different types of panes which all behave differently. A GUI consists of multiple panes which can interact with each other.

Next to those panes, GUIs can also be created from XML files by simple loading them in. This allows for easy GUI creation with little code.
